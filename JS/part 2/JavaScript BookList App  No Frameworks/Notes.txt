(1) => Book class: to represent a book,
    everytime we create a book it's gunna istantiate a book object,
    we use  this  class at  add a book 
    constructor: method that run  when we instantiate a book 
    once we get the values(form) we want ti istantiate a book from the book class 
(2) => UI class:handle UI tasks ,
    when we rmove  display a book in the list we show an alert 
    I don't want to have to istantiate the UI class (we will not create object of  this class) so we're gunna make all the method static
    we want to pull our books from local storage 
(3) => Store class: which takes care of storage ,for storing in localstorage, we want to create 3 methods ,we wanna call them directly withowt having to istantiate the store class 
(4) =>we're gunna have events: display,add,remove a book (that's both in the UI and storage (local storage ))
(5) => delete :we need to use something called event propagation where we select something above it like the book list and then  we target whatever is clicked inside of it and the we deal with it 

(6) => validation: go into where we add  a  book , in submiting form  event 
	check for all fields,if title equal nothing or author 
	we're gunna show an alert 
	instead of alert message we wanna use BS alert danger class So create showAlert method




let's add book,it's get added, If I reload it's gunna go away because we haven't persisted it to local storage
our Books: it's not getting persisted to anywhare So now we're gunna deal with the storage

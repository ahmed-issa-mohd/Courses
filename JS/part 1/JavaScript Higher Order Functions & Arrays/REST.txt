we have two arrays
companies : it has a bunch of objects 
ages : it has a simple numbers array 

do a standard for loop 
create variable called i ,we want to increment by one throgh each iteration 

ages[i] : current iteration , in each iteration we can access the current age(element)



_____________________________________
forEach 


forEach  is an  easier way  to loop through an array rather than using foor loop

it takes in a sync callback function so this takes in three things :

iterator :we can use that for each company(elelment) or whatever is in
forEach(function(iterator,index,companies)) 
the array 
index 
companies : entire array 

_____________________________________

filter  : to filter things  out (we wanna filter some elements we don't wanna get) from the  array , we're not creating a new one  like map 

we want to  all of the ages that are 21and over 
 Filter retail companies 

Get 80s companies  comapanies.filter(comapny => (company.start >= 1979 && comapny.s))

Get companies that lasted 10 years or more 

_____________________________________

map : instedad of filtering things out we can create a new array of anything from the current array 

create array of company names    
with each element in the array we can do  any thing  


_____________________________________


sort 
we pass in two values: it takes two compnies and it'll compare them and then we return 1,-1 to move it up and down in the array 
each iteration will take to companies and compare them 

sort companies  by the start  year from earliest year to  the latest 
sort ages  from lowest to highest 
_____________________________________

reduce 
add all of the ages togther 
total years for all companies

1-Transpilers can be used to compile ES6 code to ES5
Babel
Traceur
Closure

Let 
when we use  var it sets the variable  in a global scope  and then you put it inside of a loop or a function it's gonna still be that local variable 
so let gives us block scope local variable 
we can limit the scope to whatever 
with let we have block level scops
if we declare a variable in the global scope 
and then we redeclare that smae variable in a  loop or if statement  it's gonna be different 

cnstant : is for cnstants that don't change

Destructuring Assigment
helps us extract data from  array and object into distinct variables

 const list ={
   name:"Shopping List " ,
   items:["Milk","Cow"]
};

const {name,items}=list ;

Babel
JS compiler or transpiler 
compile es6 code  into es5 

go to bable cli
1 - npm init
2-npm install babel-cli babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev
3-create .babelrc  file : that's where we can specify the preset  
{
"preset" : [
	"es2015" 
]
}

4-create folder called src > main.js to write es6 code 
5-create any flolder like dist : this is where the actual app will be along with the compiled es5 code

in json file 


{
"scripts":{
"build" : " babel src -d dist "
},


"scripts":{
"build" : " babel --presets es2015 src -d dist "
}



},


Npm run build

JavaScript ES6 / ES2015 - [04] Classes and Inheritance


constructors are methods that will run  when your class is instantiated

static method :  we don't have instantiate  object to do it 

iinhert 
to use  smae props and method for parent 
super method : when  we extends parent class we need to  set  up its properties

cancatenating string to variables

JavaScript ES6 / ES2015 - [07] Default Params & Spread Operator


spread operator : is represented as three dots it used to  allow expression to be expanded  in places where  multiple arguments expected 
pass args to test using applay method  , in es6 test(...args)

JavaScript ES6 / ES2015 - [09] Arrow Functions

shorter syntax 
allow you to bind this lexically 

 we don't have to use that in function we add to costructer function to access its properties

avaScript ES6 / ES2015 - [10] Promises

promise object is used for deferred and asynchronous computations
it represents an operation that hasn't completed yet  but expected in the future 

when  we want to  display  the data on the web page  , use the JavaScript built-in function JSON.parse() to convert the string into a JavaScript object




for of loop to iterate (�����) through the elements

fetch posts Array  from a server and tht could take a couple second...  	

setTimeout it takes in a callback function and it takes in a certain amount of time  where you want to delay whatever you put in here (1000)

we're iterating through posts Array

right after the foreach  we want to insert it into the body 

the get post happened in one second (our server returned it in 1 second)
the create post took two seconds
by the time we ran this create post , the dom was already painted 
this is where Asynchronous programming comes in , callback come in which is one way to handle it 




promises

for create posts we wanna instead of passing in a callback ,we don't want to run the callback 
instead we want to return a promise 

when  you  want to  resolve a promise successfully  you call resolve 

Async Await it's a way to handle  responses it's not like a different way to write them or anything , we need to have a function that's labeled asynchronous 


Async / Await  

create a function  
this function has to  be labeled  if you wanna use await inside of it 
await  : it waits for an a synchronous process or action to complete 
we will create post  ,we want to call right before it await 
so  we're waiting for this to be done  until we move on to  call getPosts
